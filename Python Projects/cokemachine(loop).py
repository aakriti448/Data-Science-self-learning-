#suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these 
# denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, 
# each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, 
# output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, 
# and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.
